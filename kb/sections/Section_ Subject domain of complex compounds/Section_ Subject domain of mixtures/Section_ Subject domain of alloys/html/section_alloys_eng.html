<p> Alloys are one of the main structural materials. Among them, alloys based on iron and aluminum are of the greatest importance. More than 5 thousand alloys are used in engineering. </p>


<p> According to the method of making alloys, cast and powder alloys are distinguished. Cast alloys are obtained by crystallization of a melt of mixed components. Powder-pressing mixture of powders followed by sintering at high temperature. Components of a powder alloy can be not only powders of simple substances, but also powders of chemical compounds. For example, the main components of solid alloys are tungsten or titanium carbides. </p>

<p> The casting method (for example, cast iron, silumine), deformable (for example, steel) and powder alloys are distinguished by the method of obtaining the billet (product). </p>

<p> In a solid aggregate state, the alloy can be homogeneous (homogeneous, single-phase - consists of crystallites of the same type) and heterogeneous (heterogeneous, multiphase). A solid solution is the basis of the alloy (matrix phase). The phase composition of a heterogeneous alloy depends on its chemical composition. In the alloy, solid interstitial solutions, solid substitution solutions, chemical compounds (including carbides, nitrides, intermetallics) and crystallites of simple substances can be present. </p>

<p> The properties of metals and alloys are completely determined by their structure (crystal phase structure and microstructure). The macroscopic properties of alloys are determined by the microstructure and always differ from the properties of their phases, which depend only on the crystal structure. The macroscopic homogeneity of multiphase (heterogeneous) alloys is achieved due to the uniform distribution of phases in the metallic matrix. Alloys exhibit metallic properties, for example: electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, reflectivity (metallic luster), and plasticity. The most important characteristic of alloys is weldability. </p>
